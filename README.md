# CalculatorJAVAAWT
Both EvaluateString.java and prac.java are needed to run the calculator , run the prac.java file & it will create the EvaluateString class object. :) 

However , EvaluateString class evaluate only those expression which do not contain decimal values.
Any suggestion to improve this , will be gladly appreciated. <3
